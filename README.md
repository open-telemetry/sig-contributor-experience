## What is the Contributor Experience SIG?

The goal of this SIG is to improve the experience of contributors to the OpenTelemetry Project. 
To achieve this, we create programs and processes around key contribution stages, such as first commit, or the transition from regular contributor to approver.  We also consult with other SIGs to feedback into the process with an aim to improve overall community health.

## Get involved

There are many ways to get involved:

- Create [issues](https://github.com/open-telemetry/sig-contributor-experience/issues/new), comment on [existing issues](https://github.com/open-telemetry/sig-contributor-experience/issues/), or [review pull requests](https://github.com/open-telemetry/sig-contributor-experience/pulls).
- Get in touch with us on the [CNCF slack](https://slack.cncf.io/) channel [#otel-contributor-experience](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C06TMJ2R0SK).
- [Attend one of our meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CTQI0p3QF8JP8reV8z_ggcs8KE5YVPpQGvAQknw4qP0/edit#heading=h.x3xl5syz15zx). We alternate between two times to make it possible for you to join no matter which time zone you live or work in!
